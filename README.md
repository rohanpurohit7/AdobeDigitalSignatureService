# AdobeDigitalSignatureService
This service adds a signature line and digitally signs your document of choice programatically. If you have a need for authentication of documents via signature algorithms this service will help you do that. 

The addSignatureField class invokes Adobe Livecycle to add a signature field in your document of choice. 
The addDigitalSignature class then creates a digital signature on the signature field. 

This is a quickstart available from Adobe Livecycle. Your hardware security module will serve as the credential object for the digital signature.
